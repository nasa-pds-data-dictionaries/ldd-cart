# Cartography Local Data Dictionary (LDD)

The Cartography dictionary contains classes, elements, attributes, and rules describing map projections, including both cartographic and lander related definitions and descriptions. The PDS Cartography dictionary is based on and utilizes the existing Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata, with modifications and extensions applied by PDS as needed for planetary mapping application.

## Versions

- [1.B.0.0](1.9.3.0)
- [1.B.0.0_inheritance](1.9.3.0)
   This is a temporary version which is attempting to share attributes across geometry. I believe, support under the LDD tool needs to be enable to support this.
